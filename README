This program calculates the altitude and azimuth angle
of the sun at the given date and with a given tabular interval during the
whole universal day.

To install the program, please follow these instruction:

1. Create a directory for the source:
     mkdir sunpos

2. Unpack the compressed tar file inside the directory:
     gzcat sunpos-0.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     (or if you are using the GNU version of tar:
      tar xvzf sunpos-0.3,tar,gz

3. Edit the file sunpos.h to reflect your site:
     LATITUDE - your latitude in decimal degrees ( positive North )
     LONGITUDE - your longitude in decimal degrees ( positive East )

4. Compile the program:
     make

5. You can copy the executable (sunpos) to a suitable directory if
   you want. A suitable place is ~/bin. If ~/bin is in your PATH, you
   can run the program from anywhere you want.

The arguments to sunpos is:
DY = day in month (in the range 1 to 31)
MN = month of year (in the range 1 to 12 where 1=January, 2=February, ...)
YR = year
TM = tabular interval in minutes

Example: The command
                  sunpos 4 8 2019 30 > position
         will calculate the sun's position every 30 minutes from 0h UT
         on the 4th of August 2019.

Output is sent to stdout. Times are in UT and positions are in decimal degrees.
The positions are printed with an accuracy of 0.1 degrees. 

Other makeables:
     make clean   -  removes all .* and the sunpos file.
     make tar     -  tar's and gzip the distribution.
     make sunpos  -  same as make without arguments.
